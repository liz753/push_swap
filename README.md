## Project Overview
The program, called push_swap, takes a list of integers and sorts it using a set of predefined operations on two stacks. Another program, called checker, verifies the correctness of the sorting by executing the instructions generated by push_swap on the stack A.

The predefines operations are the following: 

| Operation     | Description                                          |
|     :---:     | :---         |   
|      sa       | swaps first two elements of stack A                  |
|      sb       | swaps first two elements of stack B                  |
|      ss       | sa and sb at the same time                           |
|      pa       | pops the first elememt of B and puts it on top of A  |
|      pb       | pops the first elememt of A and puts it on top of B  |
|      ra       | rotates stack A up by one, the first element becomes the last one |
|      rb       | rotates stack B up by one, the first element becomes the last one |
|      rr       | rotates both A and B up by one                       |
|      rra      | rotates stack A down by one, the last element becomes the first one |
|      rrb      | rotates stack B down by one, the last element becomes the first one |
|      rrr      | rotates both A and B down by one                     |

## Divide and Conquer 

<ins>1. Research</ins>
*   concept of sorting algorithms

<ins>2. Code Structure</ins>
*   creating a Makefile that doesn't relink
*   creating a header file 

<ins>3. Parsing</ins>
*   receive the arguments via ``ft_atoi`` and 
*   error management
     *  doubles
*   handels "1 2 3" as well as 1 2 3 


<ins>4. Implementation</ins>
*   creation of the linked list

## Tips for 42 students 
*   this project is perfect if you want to deepen your understanding about linked lists, if you want to refresh your knowledge about linked lists, I recommand this [video from the CS50 cours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T-A_GFuoTo)
