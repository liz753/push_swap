## Project Overview
The program, called push_swap, takes a list of integers and sorts it using a set of predefined operations on two stacks. Another program, called checker, verifies the correctness of the sorting by executing the instructions generated by push_swap on the stack A.

## Divide and Conquer 

<ins>1. Research</ins>
*   concept of sorting algorithms

<ins>2. Code Structure</ins>
*   creating a Makefile that doesn't relink
*   creating a header file 

<ins>3. Parsing</ins>
*   receive the arguments via ``ft_atoi`` and 
*   error management
     *  doubles
*      
*   creation of the linked list


<ins>4. Implementation</ins>
*   creation of the pipe, two file descriptors are created, the first one ``fd[0]`` being the read end and the second one ``fd[1]`` the write end     of the pipe
